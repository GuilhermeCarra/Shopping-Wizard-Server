# PHP Forms Project
### Welcome to our project developed with PHP!

#### Description
In this project we have learnt to work with PHP and HTML forms. The idea was to understand how to send information and files from the client (browser) side to the server (PHP) by sending forms.

We haven't started from scratch. We used an old project, to reformat all JS validations to PHP, adding a home page.

#### Installation
To execute our project, run a local server with Apache, Xampp, etc, and place the whole folder in your localhost. Open the directory in your browser, and automatically will execute index.php.

#### Usage
To navigate throught the project, interact with it as a usual online store. Click on a product to see detailed information and select size or color.

Once selected, purchase the product to go trhough the shipping wizard. You've got only 5 minutes to complete the purchase, otherwise, you'll be redirected to the homepage.
